After daily algo's it was onto the nuts and bolts. Two weeks later with my head spinning and we had learned HTML, CSS, JS, JQueary, Ajax, GitHub, wire framing and responsive web design. </p>

Excuse me Apache, please just fire up port 3000. Ajax... not just an all-purpose cleaner! Who knew? CodeIgnitor... sounds cool. Amazon Web Services... is this included with my PRIME membership? This was a brutal 4 weeks. </p>

	          <p class="lead">6 weeks and hanging on. But hang on tighter because itâ€™s time to hop on the Ruby on Rails train. It was a fast train covering another 4 weeks. MVC? Is that short for Malaysian Veterinary Council? TDD and RSpec... you want us to actually test our code!?! Gems...so awesome... when they work. Angular Rails? Ember? Anything else? Just deploy...to Heroku. Change that... deploy on AWS using Git (cool), Nginx (alright...), Phusion Passenger (ok, hold on here) and either PostgreSQL or SQLite3. Really!?! RoR also taught me (because of continual Windows 10 freezing) the joys of Oracle's VM VirtualBox and Ubuntu. Actually they saved my sanity.. </p>

	          <p class="lead">Train ride over and I left my brain somewhere between TDD and Nginx. Is MEAN really as difficult as I here? Yes. Yes it is. Ok then... bring on Angular. Kind of like it. Express... not so bad. Node... pretty straight forward. Mongo and Mongoose... makes me think of monkeys and bananas which make me think of palm trees which takes me tropical islands... snap out of Tom. What week are we on? MEAN is mean with its data binding and factories. But strangely enough I like it. I really like it. These 4 weeks were long but some of the best. 14 weeks later and I can program both front and back-end. Simply amazing.  </p>
